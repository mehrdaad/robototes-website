### Contributing

While we do accept and encourage contributions, this site is designed and built exclusively for The Robototes. As such, most
content comes from within the organization and code is written by a subteam. If you find any bugs, please feel free to open
an issue or write a pull request.

##### Vulnerability disclosure

If you find a vulnerability in our site, please, [report it](mailto:webmaster@robototes.com). We won't sue or anything as
long as you don't exploit any bugs and you disclose responsibly (give us time to respond and fix it before you tell the world).
If you would like to test our security, please contact us at [webmaster@robototes.com](mailto:webmaster@robototes.com) and we
can work something out.
