                    <h2>Girls Gen</h2>
                    <p>On October 22, the girls on the team (and some of the boys) went to Tahoma High School to compete in an exclusive girls-only competition, where male members are not allowed to drive the robot. Hours of drive practice paid off, as the team was ranked 6th out of 31 teams and ended up as a finalist for the second time since 2014. Even more exciting, many of the girls are new members.</p>
